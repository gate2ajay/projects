# Tutorial: langgraph

LangGraph helps you build *stateful, multi-step applications*, often used for AI agents or complex workflows.
Think of it like creating a flowchart (**Graph**) where each box (**Node**) performs an action, and the lines (**Edges**) determine the next step.
Crucially, these flows can maintain a shared **State** that nodes can read from and write to, allowing the application to evolve over time.
It provides a **Pregel** execution engine to run these graphs efficiently, supports **Checkpoints** to save and resume progress, and offers a decorator-based **Functional API** for a potentially simpler way to define workflows. **RunnableConfig** is used to pass runtime settings.
